This mod is a helper for those, who deal with the mod localization, a feature supported starting from
the KSP 1.3. It may be helpful and save a lot of efforts for both the mod authors and the community
translators.

In short, the tool can do the following:
* Extract the localizable strings from the parts of the selected mod.
* Extract the names of the events and actions from the part modules.
* Extract the GUI strings from the code.
* Reload the localization config file "on the fly", without restarting the game.
